Kiira is our beautiful sister-brand and part of our origin story. In 2017 Taz founded Kiira Jewellery –an authentically African fine jewellery brand inspired by the vibrantly diverse people,
To create impeccable fine jewellery (right here in South Africa) using ethically-sourced African gemstones, diamonds and gold to bring youpieces that are not only exquisite in their detailing, but feel-good in their creation.
In 2022, after partnering with an esteemed local auction house, Taz began designing jewellery under her own name, Taz Watson Jewellery. While the ethos of both brands remains the same, Taz Watson Jewellery now specializes exclusively in gold and platinum fine jewellery,
This passion-project lights a fire in the hearts of all involved and there is a lot happening behind thescenes with this beloved brand.
We have continued to make our best-selling Table Mountain collection (which you can now shop online here) and we are working with rural African communities to create beautiful hand-made product including bags, giftware and jewellery, which we currentlywholesale into stores abroad.
The goal of the brand is to upskill and employ women in rural communities and provide them with the materials and platform to sell their beautiful creations both locally and abroad
We are hoping to launch our new website in 2025, but for now you can follow us on Instagram@kiira__jewellery and enjoy shopping our special Intaba collection online!
Our iconic Intaba collection is a celebration of our beloved Table Mountain (one of the new 7wonders of the world) and the iconic mountain sky-line that Cape Town is known for.
Each piece features a subtle design of the mountains’ silhouette and is made with love and care in  South Africa using sterling silver, solid gold and natural African diamonds.

Taz Watson is a sought after South African fine jewellery designer and a 3rd generation gemologist with a passion for gemstones and expertly-crafted, unique jewellery. Each of her pieces is designed with the intention to be functional and comfortable, but with an air of whimsical eccentricity that brings joy and delight to the wearer.
Through her exquisite use of colour, thoughtful design details, sentimental touches and a high-quality finish, Taz manages to transform gemstones and diamonds into eye-catching, modern heirlooms that echo her unique voice.
“I don’t believe that fine jewellery needs to be too serious or trend-driven– it should be a celebration of individuality and have a meaningful, heirloom quality about it. I believe jewellery is about the feelings it evokes in you – if you feel something special when you look at it, then it will always be meaningful and timeless”.
While Taz grew up with an in-depth knowledge of the industry and was mentored by her grandfather, parents and older brother – all gemologists themselves – she formalized her expertise by attending the esteemed Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Taz studied jewellery design (JD) at the New York campus before moving to the head campus in Carlsbad, California where she graduated with Graduate Jeweler (GJ), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Gemology and Diamond grading diplomas.
Taz co-owned a demi-fine jewellery business in Canada for several years and continued to run it even after she returned to South Africa to further her industry experience in retail, custom design and manufacture. Taz also worked as a jewellery buyer for several high-end boutique stores throughout Southern Africa and has travelled to jewellery trade shows all over the world. After several years gaining a wealth of practical and technical experience, Taz decided to start her own African fine jewellery brand, KiiRA, which is best known for its high-quality and iconic Table Mountain designs and which has now evolved into a social enterprise that supports African artisans.
Recently, Taz expanded her business by creating a luxury brand under her own name and debuted Taz Watson Fine Jewellery with an exclusive 3-collection collaboration with Strauss & Co in 2022 with Jo-Ann Strauss as the face of the collaboration.  Taz continues to create limited edition collections and one-off pieces to add colour and joy to jewellery collectors all over the world.
Taz’s family’s business has specialized in gemstones, diamonds and fine jewellery for several decades and Taz is fortunate to be able to draw on these deep industry connections and have access to some of the world’s largest and most trusted diamond and gemstone cutters and suppliers.  Taz’s father is a top gemologist and jewellery and diamond expert and has been her greatest mentor whom she continues to work closely with to source exquisite, fair-priced gemstones and diamonds from all over the world, keeping provenance and the stone’s ethical footprint in close consideration.
From a design perspective, Taz has been mentored over the years by international teachers and designers with experience from some of the world’s top high-jewellery houses as well as expert gem-cutters and highly experienced goldsmith’s whom she works closely with to push creative boundaries and bring her whimsical designs to life.
